## Qumulator V2

### About this Repository
This is the second version of my original quantum computer simulator, Qumulator (2019).

### Current Plan
More .hpp files will gradually be added to implement a working quantum computer simulator:

_Complex numbers -> Matrices -> Qubit -> Set of Qubits -> Quantum Logic Gates -> Quantum Algorithm_

### Progress
* Necessary single and multi-qubit gates implemented
* Able to measure individual qubits
* Graphics library automatically generates circuit diagrams
